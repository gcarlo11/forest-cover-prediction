# Forest Cover Type Classification

## Objective
This project aims to build a deep learning model to classify forest cover types based on cartographic variables.

## Notebook Contents
The provided Jupyter Notebook, `CoverType-classification.ipynb`, contains the complete workflow for this project. The notebook is structured into the following sections:

1.  **Data Preparation**: This section includes a helper function, `prep_data`, that handles data preprocessing. It separates features from the target variable, splits the data into training and testing sets, and standardizes the numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
2.  **Model Architecture**: The notebook defines a deep neural network model using `TensorFlow` and `Keras`. The `build_model` function creates a sequential model with three dense layers, using `relu` and `softmax` activation functions. The model is compiled with the `adam` optimizer and `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss function.
3.  **Performance Visualization**:
    * `plot_heatmap`: A function to generate and save a heatmap of the **confusion matrix**, which helps visualize the model's classification performance for each class.
    * `plot_history`: A function to plot the **model's accuracy and loss over epochs**, showing how the model learns and generalizes during training.
4.  **Main Execution**: The `main` function orchestrates the entire process. It loads the dataset, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using `sweetviz`, prepares the data, builds and trains the deep learning model, and evaluates its performance on the test set. It then prints the **classification report** and displays the performance plots.

## Key Findings & Conclusions

The model achieves a test accuracy of approximately **85.42%**. However, a deeper analysis of the classification report and confusion matrix reveals some key points:

* **Misclassification**: The heatmap shows that certain classes, such as **Lodgepole Pine**, **Cottonwood/Willow**, **Aspen**, and **Douglas-Fir**, have a high rate of misclassification.
* **Performance Metrics**: The classification report provides a detailed breakdown of **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** for each class, highlighting the model's varying performance across different forest cover types. The average macro F1-score is **0.77**, indicating that the model struggles with less frequent classes.
* **Class Imbalance**: The high misclassification rate for some classes suggests a potential **class imbalance** issue in the dataset. This is a common problem in classification where the model's training is dominated by the majority class, leading to poor performance on minority classes.

## Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the model's accuracy, the following strategies can be explored:

* **Address Data Imbalance**: Implement **resampling techniques** such as oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling to balance the class distribution.
* **Feature Engineering**: Conduct a more thorough **correlation analysis** to identify and eliminate highly correlated features, which can confuse the model.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different model architectures, layer sizes, activation functions, and optimizers to find a more optimal configuration.
* **Utilize Advanced Techniques**: Consider using more advanced deep learning techniques specifically designed to handle imbalanced datasets and improve gradient-based learning for all classes.
